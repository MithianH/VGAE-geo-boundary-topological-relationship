# VGAE-geo-boundary-topological-relationship
What is this repository for?
This repository is used for analyzing the topological relationships of geological boundaries.

 

Replace data.edge_index and data.x in autoencoder_linkechange.py with the known edges of your own geologic topology graph and feature matrix;
Other references needed in autoencoder_linkechange.py, please refer to : https://github.com/pyg-team/pytorch_geometric/tree/master.
The autoencoder_linkechange.py now has a set of graph nodes and graph known edges that can be run directly.
